# Servo Driver
# -------------
# 
# library that controls the 16-Channel PWM Servo drivers from Adafruit 
# using the i2c bus on a Raspberry Pi. These drivers are based on the
# PCA9685 chip, so it can work on any other board that features these
# PWM chips. 
#  
# This library was designed to work with both normal and continuous 
# rotation servos.
